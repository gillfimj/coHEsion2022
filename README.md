Docker workshop for CoHEsion 2022

So you want to containerize your Banner applications? Have you heard a lot of talk about Docker containers but have no idea where to start? This workshop will guide you down that path, whether you want to try this in the cloud or on-prem. We'll build the environment from the ground up and show how to use the containers specifically with a Banner environment.

This workshop was held at CoHEsion 2022 on Friday 10/21/2022, 8:30am - 4:30pm.
