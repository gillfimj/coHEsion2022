# CoHEsion Conference 2022
## Containerizing Banner with Docker
### Docker workshop for CoHEsion 2022

So you want to containerize your Banner applications? Have you heard a lot of talk about Docker containers but have no idea where to start? This workshop will guide you down that path, whether you want to try this in the cloud or on-prem. We'll build the environment from the ground up and show how to use the containers specifically with a Banner environment.

This workshop was held at CoHEsion 2022 on Friday 10/21/2022, 8:30am - 4:30pm.

https://cohesioncentral.org/

There are several documents in this workshop that should be attempted in the following order:
1. Review the presentation slides in CoHEsion Containerizing Banner with Docker - Gillfillan, M.pdf
2. docs/github.doc.pdf
3. docs/docker-hub.doc.pdf
4. docs/install-docker-desktop.doc.pdf
5. docs/build-custom-tomcat.doc.pdf
6. docs/build-banner-app.doc.pdf
7. docs/updating-images.doc.pdf

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to get started creating and maintaining Banner applications in a containerized environment. Advanced topics are not discussed here, but are encouraged to be investigated on your own as a further learning task.

> You won't fully understand something until it breaks and you have to fix it. So break it!
