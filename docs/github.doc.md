# Getting Started on Github

Access to private repositories is granted to specific accounts. If you don't already have an account created, here's a quick way to get started.

## Setting up a new account

Go to: https://github.com/

Click the Sign up button in the upper right corner

Enter a valid email address.  This can be any email address of your choice.

Create a password

Enter a username that is relatively unique but yet something that will help other know who you are as this will be used to tag any updates to the repository.  This is what you'll use to login.

If the username is available, the Continue button will activate and a message will display below that says the account is available.

Make sure to take note of each value so you know how to login next time.

You may be asked if you want to receive product updates.  Feel free to answer that question as you wish.

You will then be asked to verify you are human.  Good luck with that.

Then you can click the button to Create Account

You will then be sent a Launch Code to verify your email address. Check your email at the address you provided and enter the Launch Code to continue with the setup process.

You may then be asked a series of setup questions.
* How many team members will be working with you?
* Are you a student or teacher?
* What specific features are you interested in using?
 
Feel free to skip the personalization

If you're new to Git and/or Github, feel free to read the guide that is provided on the Dashboard as you first login.
* Warning, this is a rabbit hole you can wind down for a while, so tread cautiously.

We highly encourage the use of 2 Factor Authentication whenever possible.  Github provides the flexibility of choosing which Authenticator you want to use.  Just make sure you remember which Authenticator you link your account to and be sure to download your recovery codes, so when you forget which Authenticator you've link your account to you have a way to get back into your account.
